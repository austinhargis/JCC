- About: This screen lists the developer name and the id for the course it was developed for. 

## Testing Methodologies 
Unfortunately, as I was unable to get my Rooms to work properly during the development of the app, not a whole lot of testing was able to be done. 

## Usage
You can just run the app. There are no special usernames, passwords, or any other bits of information that are necessary. 

## Lessons Learned
Throughout this process, I learned that mobile app development is significantly more difficult than desktop app development. There are far more programming and design conventions that must be followed for mobile development than there are for desktop applications. It can be easy to rapidly prototype a desktop application in something like Python or C++, but configuring and prototyping a mobile app is more time consuming and can be tedious at times.
